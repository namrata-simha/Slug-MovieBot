# Slug-MovieBot
We are a team of graduate students from UCSC. In this project, we are focussing on building a functional chat-bot that answers questions about movies. In addition, we aim at incorporating the ability to offer an opinion on the question asked based on public opinion from Tweets about the same. This is an extension on MovieBot(https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MRKGF5W), so as to provide more of a human touch to the bot by adding an opinion to the responses to the questions asked by a user.
